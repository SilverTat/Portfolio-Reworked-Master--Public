            <h2>Brief / Problem space</h2>
            <p>Due to unclarities during the initial brief explanation the project group and the representative from
                Region halland bemaningsenheten drafted a new brief. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The project leader and the representative from Region halland were quick to design a new brief with a
                different problem space that our group could work on. It was only later that we were informed about the
                miscommunication.
            </p>
            <p>
                The new briefs problem space encompassed Region halland and the bemanningsenheten. Today region
                hallands bemanningsenheten is in need of a more effective system for booking personnel who can drive and
                administer proper care inside of ambulances. This
                includes dividing work hours more efficiently and equally, seeing what competences different individuals
                have as well as having an efficient overview of work hours that are missing personnel and what
                competencies are needed inside the
                ambulance.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>Due to the systems used by Region halland being highly confidential, the project team aimed to gain a
                greater understanding of how the booking system works today, identifying areas of improvement and
                creating a more effective an user friendly
                artefact for both the administrators and personnel.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The project resulted in a thought out artefact more catered towards the different users of the system.
                The artefact aimed to streamline booking done by the administrators of the system as well as giving
                personnel a better overview, and more
                security in their work hours. With this said, a design manual was developed, but further improvements
                and evaluations of the artefact needs to be carried out before its put to use inside of such a sensitive
                area.
            </p>
            <p>
                However the representatives were very happy with the prototype that were developed for them in such a
                short timespan. And that it gave them a lot of insights into how a possible booking system could work in
                the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                The final solution consisted of:
                <br><br>&#x2022; A Sitemap
                <br><br>&#x2022; A mixed fidelity prototype in figma

            <h3>Takeaways - Summary</h3>
            <p>
                <i>Using premade modules</i> - Using or taking inspiration from complex models when coding can
                drastically cut time spent coding.
                <br><br>
                <i>Further insights in analysis and discussion</i> - Being able to analyse data is great! But
                so is analysing what your project team members are saying and feeling! Being able to incorporate every
                members,
                sometimes different opinions is hard, but a skill thats worth learning.
                <br><br>
                <i>Cost of the booking medium</i> - Is the booking medium competitivley priced for the
                experience its offering?
                <br><br>
                <i>Time and workflow managment</i> - Ive learned to better manage the timeframes for group
                based projects. I learned that using prebuilt modules for complex features while code can save
                substantial amounts of time if needed.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="ProjectsPrimary2" id="Takeaways">
            <!-- <img src="./assets/test.png" style="width: 2"> -->

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>From this project I learned the importance of using off the shelf code to be able to finish and
                understand how to code complicated functions. The hardest part of coding the artefact for this project
                was coding a dynamic calendar, something
                I had done earlier with the help of off the shelf modules. Whilst trying my hand at coding a dynamic
                calendar from scratch I realised how complex this undertaking actually was, and that off the shelf
                modules often can help complete a project.
                <br><br>
                I've also further developed my analysing and discussion abilities. Being able to keep all members of the
                team in mind while designing and making decisions is hard, but also an integral component of sustaining
                team morale.
                <br><br>
                I also further increased my understanding of time managment and increased my knowledge of workflow
                management by the side of the
                project leader, something I have earlier experience with from my gymnasium where we had courses in
                project
                leading. Due to my earlier experience
                of leading teams I have garnered huge respect for project leaders and how time consuming the job is as a
                whole. You constantly need to have an overview of what everyone in the team is doing, how far along they
                are and if something is running
                late.

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>After establishing the brief and, with it the need for a proper booking system for Bemmaningsenheten we
                then
                started doing research with different design activities. We started off with a competitor analysis,
                where we studied different booking systems
                used amongst different companies.
            </p>
            <p>
                The evaluation of these booking methods were graded on a point scale were 1 was the least user friendly,
                and 5 the most
                user friendly. The five categories that were graded was, simpleness of
                use, time to book different timeslots, cost
                of the booking medium and availability for actors. The project team garnered insights regarding how the
                future booking artefact should preferably function. Where some of the most important insights the
                booking system being easy to learn,
                being limited to a specific app where all the information was stored, this to avoid notifications being
                lost amidst other notifications e.g. amongst users private mails, and that cost did not play a major
                role to most companies due to
                it being relatively small to a big, well funded company.
            </p>
            <p>
                Interviews were also conducted with administrative and on the ground personnel to garner insights into
                how the system works today. After this the project team used cooperativ design with most of the
                interviewees to create a lifelike persona that could
                guide the future design.

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>
                The project team started of the ideation phase by co-designing a persona with individuals from Region
                Halland who would use the system. This was done at the end of each conducted interview.
                </p>
                With the persona as a base, a scenario could be developed to further increase understanding, and
                empathize
                with the users to be.
                <br><br>
                Next up the project team started creating a sitemap based on the analysed interviews.
                <br><br>
                Once the sitemap was completed the project team created four different wireframes that were created on
                paper and in the wireframing tool balsamiq. These different wireframes and their elements were discussed
                and <i>Frankensteined</i> together based on their strengths and weaknesses.

            <h2>Prototype & Evaluation</h2>
            <p>The project team then started creating a high fidelity prototype in figma. The prototype in figma showed
                a fully functioning flow chart of the navigational architecture, and a booking system. This was meant as
                a
                highly detailed example of how
                a future implemented artefact would look and could work in practice. </p>
            <p>
                Besides the figma prototype a coded prototype was created by me, with input and help from another group
                member. The prototype was very mixed fidelity and a very early work. Initially I expected it'd be easy
                to create a calendar, but I ran into problems
                when trying to make it dynamic. A variety of different prebuilt calendars were used in the prototype
                before settling on an adequate one. A coded prototype was created solely for the purpose of showing that
                it was technically possible to
                create a booking system, and was far from as complete as the figma prototype, and only a proof of
                concept.
            </p>
            <p>The project team created an evaluation guide for the figma prototype. The evaluation guide was based on
                tasks that were measured in completion time, with follow up questions regarding the navigational and
                informational architecture off the
                prototype. </p>
            <p>
                All in all four evaluations were conducted, two with non expert users and two with expert
                users of the current system. During the interviews small insights were gained into little things that
                could be tweaked to make the artefact
                even better.

                This was probably due to the low sample size of the evaluation and most of the large issues with the
                prototype being hammered out in the early stages of development through critic sessions held with other
                students during the design studio.

                Through the earlier stages of development the artefact garnered criticism towards different areas,
                mostly directed towards how information was presented and how it could be presented more clearly. E.g.
                what region a work pass was related to and the size and readability of buttons.

            <h2>Final artefact</h2>
            <p>With major flaws in the artefact being corrected for during the earlier stages of development the final
                artefact resulted in having a more refined menu structure, a revised and clearer schedule structure,
                increasing the size of certain buttons
                (to make them easier to press) and changing different markings in the schedule.
                <br><br>
                As an example of this,
                the marker for todays date was under heavy debate throughout the process. Although this was most likely
                due to different schedule application
                marking the date differently. And the project team
                finally settled on a marking that was deemed adequate
                for most users.
                <br><br>
                The final solution consists of:
                <br><br>&#x2022; A Sitemap
                <br><br>&#x2022; A mixed fidelity prototype in figma
                <br><br>&#x2022; A design manual
            </p>
