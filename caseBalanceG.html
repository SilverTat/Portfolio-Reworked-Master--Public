                <h2>TAKEAWAYS</h2>
                <p>
                    With this being my first practical design project I gained a lot of insight into the intricacies of
                working within a team. During the project I was responsible for evaluation, this meant that I planned
                and developed methods for generating
                data relating to the user experience (UX) of the artefact. I was also responsible for planning and
                developing the interview guides for the project.
                <br><br>
                I learned how hard it is to create interview guides from scratch, and how something that seems so simple
                can take a lot of time to get right. The same is true for creating methods of evaluation
                for the <i>original artefact</i>. As well
                as the improved iterations created by the project team. Therefore I garnished a lot of knowledge of how
                to use and modify existing evaluation criteria for artefacts and interview guide templates.
                <br><br>
                I also quickly came to the realisation that what the brief says is needed for a specific project, isn't
                always necessarily true. What the brief says the client needs is often colored with the bias of the
                client and as a design team each member
                has to take on the responsibility of examining the brief critically with an observing eye.
                <br><br>
                I came to the realisation that there's not always major differences in users' needs for information
                based on their age. But the needs, at least in this case, had granular differences. Older users wanted
                to have a
                deeper emotional connection with the
                trainers, whilst younger users didn't have this need and mostly wanted to know more about the practical
                aspects of the concepts.
                <br><br>
                With this being my first design project I gained a deeper understanding of how there's no perfect design
                solution. And no matter how long you spend on a design solution the design will never be perfect.
                Furthermore I understood how hard it
                is to design a solution when you're not in close contact with the client. But I also realised that you
                can't put the project on hold for too long even if it's hard to get a hold of your client because at the
                end of the day you still have
                to deliver a solution, whether or not the client was involved or not.
                <br><br>
                Finally, and probably my biggest takeaway, I learned a lot about how to gather and analyse data. Both
                how to continuously analyse and themathise interviewees answers during an interview or evaluation, as
                well as analysing and themathising
                large datasets from interviews. This is something that is quite time consuming and hard to be efficient
                at. But to me,
                it's very stimulating and very fun. I came to the realisation that i love analysing and seeing abstract
                patterns in data relating to users
                thoughts, feelings and actions toward certain design choices.

                <h2>TAKEAWAYS - <span id="highlightTxt">TL;DR</span></h2>

                <p><i>Interview guides</i> - Designing interview guides are challenging. Using guidelines when learning to
                    create interview guides can help a lot. Trying to imagine possible answers to each question asked in an
                    interview can help further shape a iterate the questions.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Critically analysing the brief</i> - Starting of by critically examining the clients own percevied
                    wants and need in the brief is a good starting point. Sometimes clients arent really awware of what they
                    actually need to solve a specific problem.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Differences in needs for users</i> - Different demographic user groups, can seemingly have the same
                    needs and wants. But you have to look carefullyy for granular differences in these needs and wants,
                    because theyre almost always present.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>No perfect design solution</i> - Altough kind of obvious, theres never gonna be one, singular,
                    perfect design solution that fits every specific member.
                    <br><br>
                    <i>Gathering and analysing data</i> - A seemingly monotonous task, that i find very stimulating. Theres
                    something about the challenge of gathering data and then analysing it that just the perfect amount of
                    challenging and fun!

                <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
                <p>The design team began the project by examining the brief and looking over the artefact the brief was
                    based on. The team could see issues with the original artefact and I started to plan and design an
                    evaluation. I ended up basing the evaluation
                    on Andy Budds “Heuristics For Modern Web Application Development”, and the project team performed the
                    evaluation together.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the evaluation was complete the project team concluded that the major issue that the artefact
                    faced was a less than ideal informational and navigational architecture. The team kept these things in
                    mind when moving forward. We concluded that we needed
                    input from users regarding what information that was missing and what information that was superfluous.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Keeping the heuristic evaluation in mind I started to design a interview guide that would help the
                    project team gain a deeper understanding of what potential users wanted to see on the website.

                <p>
                    After the initial research was done the project team wanted to define a sitemap with improved
                    navigational and informational architecture. To do this the team used cardsorting with potential users
                    of the site, to gain a understanding of what, to them, was the most intuitive way to structure the
                    website.
                    <br><br>
                    Next up the team created a persona based on interviews, this was done to further understand and
                    empathize with what users need and wanted to see on the website.
                    <br><br>
                    After this a sitemap was drafted and itterated upon.
                    <br><br>
                    Finally all group members drafted sketches based on the final iteration of the sitemap. Each sketch had
                    its own strength and weaknesses, therefore the group merged different placements of elements / functions
                    of the different sketches into one! A Process i like calling "Frankensteining".

                <p>
                    The prototype was created in Figma. And the project team could then move on to user testing. I developed
                    the initial draft for the user testing which consisted of different navigation tasks that were timed,
                    followed by followup questions aimed
                    towards the users that were taking part in the usertesting.</p>
                <p>
                    By measuring the completion time of the navigation tasks clear outliers could be identified and the team
                    could take measures to iterate the navigation even further to make it more effective. The followup
                    questions were mainly geared towards gaining a
                    deeper understanding of what the users thought about the different navigation tasks and how they could
                    be improved further.

                <h2>FINAL ARTEFACT</h2>
                <p>The project resulted in a design manual that was provided to Balance golf. The design manual was a highly
                    detailed framework of how to improve the informational architecture of the Balance golf website in
                    accordance with L., Morville, P.,
                    & Arango, J. (2015). Information architecture : for the Web and beyond (4. ed.). O’Reilly. Aswell as
                    additional information that golfers who might try out the Balance golf concept wanted to see presented
                    on the website.
                </p>
                <p> The designmanual cosists of things such as:<br><br>&#x2022; Methods used throughout the project
                    <br><br>&#x2022; A sitemap for increased ease of navigation and improved informational architecture
                    <br><br>&#x2022; A Mixed fidelity prototype
                    in Figma
                    <br><br>&#x2022; An ER-model
                    <br><br>&#x2022; A Coded prototype <br><br>&#x2022; And information about further development
