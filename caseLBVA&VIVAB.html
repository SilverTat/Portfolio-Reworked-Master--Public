                <h2>CASE BRIEF</h2>
                <p>During <span id="highlightTxt">Designstudio - smart societies</span> my project team and i worked
                    with
                    <span id="highlightTxt">LBVA and VIVAB</span>, two municipally
                    sponsored companies that act as <span id="highlightTxt">water managers for Halmstad, Laholm and
                        Falkenbergs</span> municipals. The
                    brief, provided by LBVA and VIVAB,
                    expressed a need to <span id="highlightTxt">change user habits and attitudes towards the use of
                        freshwater</span>, a.k.a. drinking
                    /
                    tap
                    water.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LBVA and VIVAB wanted to <span id="highlightTxt">make actors</span> such as, private individuals and
                    companies <span id="highlightTxt">conscious of
                        freshwater
                        as a finite resource</span> and as a prerequisite for all life to function normally. This
                    involved making
                    actors <span id="highlightTxt">stop wasting freshwater</span> on, e.g.
                    cleaning their cars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    LBVA and VIVAB had <span id="highlightTxt">previously co-founded a another project</span>. The
                    goal of the project
                    was to develop a tool to <span id="highlightTxt">map actor's water usage</span>. This, along with a
                    project report, was
                    <span id="highlightTxt">handed
                        over to us</span> at the begining at the project for further development.

                <h2>RESULTS</h2>
                <p>After a lot of iterations the design resulted in a <span id="highlightTxt">satisfactory visual
                        artefact</span>, with further room for
                    improvement. But it would function as <span id="highlightTxt">a concept for further

                </p>
                <p>
                    Serveral different <span id="highlightTxt">service design methods</span> were used throughout the
                    project.
                    <span id="highlightTxt">Three customer journeys</span> were developed to represent different stages
                    of
                    implementation.
                    <span id="highlightTxt">The first</span> of these were a customer journey presenting how a user
                    would navigate
                    <span id="highlightTxt">the
                        service today</span>.
                    <span id="highlightTxt">The second</span> journey was based on <span id="highlightTxt">future

                        LBVA & VIVAB</span>.
                    <span id="highlightTxt">The third</span> journey was dubbed <span id="highlightTxt">"preffered

                <p>

                <h2>TAKEAWAYS</h2>
                <p>
                    During this design studio I learned how hard it can be to <span id="highlightTxt">not tunnel
                        vision</span> once the
                    design process has already started. The project group <span id="highlightTxt">initially wanted to
                        design a service</span> based on
                    <span id="highlightTxt">current measures being taken by LBVA and
                        VIVAB</span>, however this <span id="highlightTxt">did not fulfil the course goals</span> and it
                    was hard to shift focus.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also learned a lot more about <span id="highlightTxt">service design</span> and what <span
                        id="highlightTxt">methods</span> might be suited to which parts of a
                    design process.

                </p>
                <p>
                    I gained further knowledge in <span id="highlightTxt">project managing within a smaller
                        subgroup</span> of a project and how to
                    properly <span id="highlightTxt">communicate relevant and important topics</span> of discussion
                    within
                    different teams in a
                    larger
                    project.

                <p><i><span id="highlightTxt">Tunnel vision</span></i> - Breaking free from tunnel vision can be hard
                    once the design process is already
                    started.
                </p>

                <p><i><span id="highlightTxt">Service design methods</span></i> - Service deisn methods are often very
                    complex and hard to
                    understand. But they can be immensly usefull when designing and explaining a concept!
                </p>

                <p><i><span id="highlightTxt">Managing projects</span></i> - Leading a smaller subgroup focused, mostly,
                    on the service design of
                    the project gave me further appreciation for project managers. Having a constant overview of what is
                    being done and if deadlines are being met can be stressfull. But if done right is an adequatley
                    challenging and fun task!

                <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
                <p>The project team started off the <span id="highlightTxt">initial research</span> by trying to <span
                        id="highlightTxt">understand the concept of “water
                        smartness”</span> that was mentioned in the brief supplied by LBVA and VIVAB. However, there was

                        agreed upon</span> or accepted <span id="highlightTxt">definition</span> of water
                    smartness established. The group came to the conclusion that this is most likely <span
                        id="highlightTxt">due to lacking
                        interest</span>
                    and the subject <span id="highlightTxt">not being addressed properly</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The project team decided to <span id="highlightTxt">conduct a <i>omvärldsanalys</i></span> to
                    <span id="highlightTxt">explore other countries perspectives</span> on water and how they handle

                    Thus we <span id="highlightTxt">studdied different initiatives</span> from other countries and <span
                        id="highlightTxt">how they their freshwater supplies
                        in a sustainable way</span>. Academic literature and other information channels across the web
                    were used. The
                    <span id="highlightTxt">project report from COWI</span> supplied by LBVA and VIVAB was also used for
                    this research.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During the research the project group observed that <span id="highlightTxt">small and medium
                        companies</span> said they were
                    <span id="highlightTxt">willing to
                        become more conscious of their freshwater usage,</span> and in turn, become more watersmart but
                    that <span id="highlightTxt">they
                        did
                        not know how to</span>. We also observed, what we
                    defined as, a <span id="highlightTxt">conscious or unconscious ignorance</span> within companies
                    regarding “water smartness”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally we observed that most of the <span id="highlightTxt">information pertaining to
                        “watersmartness”</span> were found in
                    <span id="highlightTxt">academic
                        articles / literature and global agendas</span>. Further most <span id="highlightTxt">measures
                        were designed for private
                        households</span>. In
                    short we observed a plethora of measures that
                    private households could take to become more “watersmart” but also observed a <span
                        id="highlightTxt">lack of measures
                        designed
                        for companies</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To garner <span id="highlightTxt">further insights</span> of the water consumption and water
                    consciousness of companies the project
                    team developed an <span id="highlightTxt">interview guide</span>. <span id="highlightTxt">Through
                        the interviews</span> we concluded that most
                    companies had a clear overview <span id="highlightTxt">of how the companies
                        used their water</span>, but they <span id="highlightTxt">couldn't answer</span> questions
                    regarding <span id="highlightTxt">how much water specific parts of
                        their
                        facilities consumed</span>. When the companies were questioned about if the had taken any <span
                        id="highlightTxt">measures to
                        become
                        more “watersmart”</span> the companies
                    mentioned more general <span id="highlightTxt">measures like water-saving faucets</span>, but
                    nothing company specific.

                <p>
                    We <span id="highlightTxt">divided the project group into two different teams</span>, one that would
                    <span id="highlightTxt">develop the artefact</span> that
                    was
                    <span id="highlightTxt">primarily designed for the users of the water</span> <i>and not LBVA and
                        VIVAB</i> and another one that would
                    <span id="highlightTxt">develop
                        the service</span> behind the artefact.
                    Each group also had a member that would act as a <span id="highlightTxt">project manager within the
                        teams</span>. I
                    was appointed as head of the service design group.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Both teams had <span id="highlightTxt">daily scrums to keep eachother updated</span> on what they
                    were working on and how far into
                    the
                    process each group had gotten. These scrums also served to make sure that the direction either team
                    was taking was in line with what the other team had in mind.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This lead to the development of <span id="highlightTxt">three different customer journeys</span>,
                    one for the <span id="highlightTxt">current state</span>, <span id="highlightTxt">future
                        state</span> and one called <span id="highlightTxt">preferred future state</span>. The <span
                        id="highlightTxt">current
                        state customer journey</span> was <span id="highlightTxt">based on
                        existing
                        artefacts</span> already implemented by LBVA and VIVAB
                    and different actors. The <span id="highlightTxt">future state customer journey was based on
                        measures that are currently
                        being
                        implemented</span> and what could be done to further their usefulness in making actors more
                    conscious of
                    their
                    freshwater usage. And finally
                    the <span id="highlightTxt">preferred future state customer journey was created to visualise an
                        ideal
                        customer journey</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <span id="highlightTxt">scenario was then created</span> based on the <span
                        id="highlightTxt">preferred future state customer journey</span>, as a sort of short
                    novel. The <span id="highlightTxt">scenario had the purpose of explaining the customer
                        journey</span> in depth and more
                    pedagogically.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A <span id="highlightTxt">service blueprint</span> could then enter development <span
                        id="highlightTxt">based on</span> the <span id="highlightTxt">customer journey</span> and the
                    <span id="highlightTxt">scenario</span>. The
                    service blueprint was meant to give LBVA and VIVAB a <span id="highlightTxt">clear overview</span>
                    of how the <span id="highlightTxt">technical parts</span> of
                    the
                    service <span id="highlightTxt">would work together with employees</span> developing
                    company specific measures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <span id="highlightTxt">business model canvas</span> was the developed to concretely explain to
                    LBVA and VIVAB how the service
                    would
                    <span id="highlightTxt">deliver value to them</span>, <span id="highlightTxt">consumers of
                        freshwater and society as whole</span>, framed from a climate
                    perspective.
                </p>

                <p>
                    A <span id="highlightTxt">service roadmap</span> was also developed to help LBVA and VIVAB <span
                        id="highlightTxt">start development and implementation</span> of

                <p>
                    A <span id="highlightTxt">service specification</span> was also developed to give a high fidelity
                    explanation of what and <span id="highlightTxt">how different parts</span> of the service
                    roadmap were to <span id="highlightTxt">be developed and implemented</span>. As well as explaining
                    more in depth what the different
                    “sprints” in the service roadmap entailed and why they were important.

                    <span id="highlightTxt">figma</span>. This prototype served to
                    show
                    the <span id="highlightTxt">navigational architecture</span>, and a <span id="highlightTxt">booking
                        system in high fidelity</span>.
                    And was ultimately
                    meant as
                    a
                    highly detailed example of how

                    when trying to make it dynamic. A variety of <span id="highlightTxt">different prebuilt

                    However, the limited sample

                    The evaluation process led to <span id="highlightTxt">significant refinements</span> in the final
                    artefact, including a
                    <span id="highlightTxt">streamlined menu structure</span>, a <span id="highlightTxt">clearer
                        schedule layout</span>, <span id="highlightTxt">larger buttons</span>
                    for easier interaction, and
                    updated <span id="highlightTxt">schedule markers</span>. For instance, marking the current date was
                    a topic of extensive debate,
                    influenced by variations in how other scheduling applications handle this feature. Ultimately,
                    the team settled on a marking approach that balanced functionality and user preferences.
