            <h2>Brief / Problem space</h2>
            <p>During Designstudio - smart societies my project team and i worked with LBVA and VIVAB, two municipally
                sponsored companies that act as water managers for Halmstad, Laholm and Falkenbergs municipals. The
                brief, provided by LBVA and VIVAB,
                expressed a need to change user habits and attitudes towards the use of freshwater, a.k.a. drinking /
                tap
                water.
            </p>
            <p>
                LBVA and VIVAB wanted to make actors such as, private individuals and companies conscious of freshwater
                as a finite resource and as a prerequisite for all life to function normally. This involved making
                actors stop wasting freshwater on, e.g.
                cleaning their cars.
            </p>
            <p>
                LBVA and VIVAB had previously been cofounders of a project developed another design firm. The project
                was conducted to develop a tool to map actor's water usage, this along with a project report, was handed
                over to the project group for further development.

            <h2>Goals</h2>
            <p>In short the goal of the design studio was to make actors more conscious about their fresh water usage
                and ultimately prevent wasteful water usage.

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>After a lot of iterations the disgn resulted in a satisfactory visual artefact, with further room for
                improvement. But it would function as a concept for further development.</p>
            <p>
                Serveral different service design methods were used throughout the project.
                <br><br> &#x2022; Three customer journeys were developed to represent different stages of
                implementation.
                <br><br> &nbsp; &#45;The first of these were a customer journey presenting how a user would navigate the
                service today.
                <br> &nbsp; &#45;The second journey was based on current implementation efforts and systems being used
                by
                LBVA & VIVAB.
                <br> &nbsp; &#45;The third journey was dubbed "preffered future state" and tried to present the most
                satisfactory journey a customer could have.

                <br><br>&#x2022; A business model canvas was created.
                <br><br>&#x2022; A service roadmap was created.
                <br><br>&#x2022; Two artefacts, one for the web and one for mobile usage.
                <br><br>&#x2022; Finally general guidelines for further development.

            <h3>Takeaways - Summary</h3>
            <p>
                <i>Tunnel vision</i> - Breaking free from tunnel vision can be hard once the design process is already
                started.
                <br><br> <i>Service design methods</i> - Service deisn methods are often very complex and hard to
                understand. But they can be immensly usefull when designing and explaining a concept!
                <br><br> <i>Project leading</i> - Leading a smaller subgroup focused, mostly, on the service design of
                the project gave me further appreciation for project leading. Having a constant overview of what is
                being done and if deadlines are being met can be stressfull. But if done right is an adequatley
                challenging and fun task!

            <h2>Takeaways</h2>
            <p>During this design studio I learned how hard it can be to get out of tunnel vision focus once the
                design process has already started. The project group initially wanted to design a service based on
                current measures being taken by LBVA and
                VIVAB, however this did not fulfil the course goals and it was hard to shift focus.
                <br><br>
                I also learned a lot more about service design and what methods might be suited to which parts of a
                design process.
                <br><br>
                I gained further knowledge in project managing within a smaller subgroup of a project and how to
                properly communicate relevant and important topics of discussion with other subgroups within a larger
                project.

            <!-- <img src="./assets/test.png" style="width: 2"> -->

            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>The project team started off the initial research by trying to understand the concept of “water
                smartness” that was mentioned in the brief supplied by LBVA and VIVAB. However, there was no generally
                agreed upon or accepted definition of water
                smartness established. The group came to the conclusion that this is most likely due to lacking interest
                and the subject not being addressed properly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project team decided to conduct a omvärldsanalys to explore other countries perspective on water and
                how they handle their freshwater supplies. Different initiatives from countries to use their freshwater
                supplies in a sustainable way were studied,
                as well as academic literature and other information channels across the web. The project report from
                COWI supplied by LBVA and VIVAB was also used during the research.
            </p>
            <p>
                During the research the project group observed that small and medium companies said they were willing to
                become more conscious of their freshwater users, and in turn, become more watersmart but that they did
                not know how to. We also observed, what we
                defined as, a conscious or unconscious ignorance within companies regarding “water smartness”.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally we observed that most of the information pertaining to “watersmartness” were found in academic
                articles / literature and global agendas. Further most measures were designed for private households. In
                short we observed a plethora of measures that
                private households could take to become more “watersmart” but also observed a lack of measures designed
                for companies.
            </p>
            <p>
                To garner further insights of the water consumption and water consciousness of companies the project
                team developed an interview guide. Through the interviews that were conducted we concluded that most
                companies had a clear overview of how the companies
                used their water, but they couldn't answer questions regarding how much water specific parts of their
                facilities consumed. When the companies were questioned about if the had taken any measures to become
                more “watersmart” the companies
                mentioned more general measures like water-saving faucets, and nothing company specific.

            <h3>Insights from the research</h3>
            <p><i>What is water smartness?</i> - No clear singular definition.

                <br><br> <i>Conscious or unconscious ignorance</i> - Small and medium companies are willing to use
                freshwater more responsibly, but dont know how to.
                <br><br> <i>Softcore gatekeeping</i> - Most of the publically available information regarding, water
                smartness, is available in academic litterature and global agendas making it hard to find.
                <br><br> <i>Differences in available measures</i> - General measures that could be taken to become more
                watersmart were plentifull. Mainly by switching to watersmart faucets, showerheads and etc. Measures for
                different industrial endeavours were nowhere to be found.

            <h3>Ideation phase outcomes</h3>
            <p>
                <br><br> <i>Customer journeys</i> - Three customer journeys were created for the project. One
                representing
                current state, another for a future state based on the current implementations being performed by LBVA &
                VIVAB and finally a third preffered future state based on the most satisfactory journey a customer could
                have.

                <br><br> <i>Scenario</i> - A scenario was created to explain the preffered customer journey more
                pedagogically.

                <br><br> <i>Service blueprint</i> - A business model vancas to further explain the service for LBVA.

                <br><br> <i>Business model canvas</i> - A business model canvas was developed to clearly explain for
                LBVA &
                VIVAB what value the service would deliver for both them and their customers.

                <br><br> <i>Service roadmap</i> - A service roadmap was developed to help LBVA & VIVAB develop the
                service.

            <!-- <img src="./assets/test.png" style="width: 2"> -->

            <h2>Ideation</h2>
            <p>Initially the group had problems actually starting the ideation phase. Given that this design studio was
                a course during our studies at Halmstad University we had certain criteria the project had to fulfil.
                This meant that the initial idea
                the group had, developing a service that implemented current efforts and implementation from LBVA and
                VIVAB side, didn't fully meet the course goals. Therefore the group decided to shift focus and look even
                further into the future.
                <br><br>
                We divided the project group into two different subgroups, one that would develop the artefact that was
                primarily designed for the users of the water (not LBVA and VIVAB) and another one that would develop
                the service with tools created for service design.
                Each group also had a primary head / leader that would act as a project manager within the subgroups. I
                was appointed as head of the service design group and a colleague was appointed as the head of the
                other.
                <br><br>
                Both groups had daily scrums to keep eachother updated on what they were working on and how far into the
                process each group had gotten. During these scrums both subgroups also checked that the groups were
                taking, either the service design part or the
                artefact design part of the project in the direction the respective groups had in mind.

                <br><br>
                This lead to the development of three different customer journeys, one for the current state, future
                state and one called preferred future state. The current state customer journey was based on existing
                artefacts and communication between LBVA and VIVAB
                and different actors. The future state customer journey was based on measures that are currently being
                implemented and what could be done to further their usefulness in making actors more conscious of their
                freshwater usage. And finally
                the preferred future state customer journey was created visualise a, for the project group, ideal
                customer journey.
                <br><br>
                A scenario was then created based on the preferred future state customer journey, as a sort of short
                novel. The scenario had the purpose of explaining the customer journey more broadly and pedagogically.
                <br><br>
                A service blueprint could then enter development based on the customer journey and the scenario. The
                service blueprint was meant to give LBVA and VIVAB to a clear overview how the technical parts of the
                service would work together with employees developing
                company specific measures.
                <br><br>
                A business model canvas was the developed to concretely explain to LBVA and VIVAB how the service would
                deliver value to them, consumers of freshwater and society as whole, framed from a climate perspective.
                <br><br>
                A service roadmap was also developed to help LBVA and VIVAB start development and implementation of the
                service, if they so wished. A service specification was also developed to give a high fidelity
                explanation of what and how different parts of the service
                roadmap were to be developed and implemented. As well as explaining more in depth what the different
                “sprints” in the service roadmap entailed and why they were important.

            <h2>Prototype & Evaluation</h2>
            <p>The project group started working on a visual artefact that actors would interact with when using the
                service. Before prototyping of the UI could begin the project group started of by doing more research
                about how similar artefacts was designed
                around the world. A particularly relevant area of study was energy consumption and how this was
                presented in a user friendly way. We quickly realised that energy consumption was often presented in
                graphs and different energy curves.</p>
            <p>
                With this in mind the part of the project group responsible for the visual artefact initially created an
                artefact for the service. The artefact contained various visualisations of a company's freshwater usage
                in the form of 2D graphs.
            </p>
            <p>
                However due to me mainly being responsible for the subgroup developing the service my group was not
                overly involved in this process. As previously mentioned.
            </p>
            <p>
                During critique sessions with other student colleagues the artefact was refined further. As an example
                we garnered insights about how to present water consumption efficiently. Due to water often being
                measured in three dimensions and not two dimensions
                the project group decided to use 3D graphs for representation of the water usage instead of 2D graphs.

            </p>
            <p>
                The initial information architecture was also changed due to the artefact being perceived as
                overwhelming or boring. The project group also performed a type of cardsorting to explore how users
                would want their water usage presented to them in this type
                of artefact. In the cardsorting participants had to sort out predetermined elements that would be part
                of the artefact, however they see fit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cardsorting resulted in further insights of how the informational architecture should be designed
                within the artefact.

            <h2>Final artefact</h2>

            <p>The designstudio resulted in a plethora of service design tools for development and implementation of the
                service.
                <br><br>
                <i>First and foremost was three different customer journey maps</i>, one was developed based on the
                current
                service. The second customer journey was based on efforts currently being implemented and how these
                efforts could potentially affect actors and help them
                reduce their wasteful use of the finite freshwater supply. Third and lastly, we create a “Preferred
                future state customer journey” this customer journey envisioned a future not limited by current efforts
                already being implemented.
                <br><br>
                <i>Secondly a service blueprint</i> was created to envision how the service would work between all
                involved
                actors and artefacts. This service blueprint was based of the “preferred future state customer journey”.
                The service presented what actions customers
                would do and how this corresponded to fronstage actions (the employees at LBVA and VIVAB), how the
                customers would interact with the artefacts, how these interactions were then communicated to the
                backstage actions taken by the employees
                at LBVA and VIVAB and finally backstage support processes handled by the databases of these artefacts.
                <br><br>
                <i>Thirdly business model canvas</i> was drafted to clearly convey how the service, based on the
                “preferred
                future state map” would create value for LBVA and VIVAB, private actors and society as a whole.
                <br><br>
                <i>Fourth a service roadmap</i> for development and implementation of the service was developed to help
                LBVA
                and VIVAB plan a potential development and implementation strategy for the service. The service roadmap
                spanned a total of eight years but efforts to
                implement such a large scale service could potentially be longer due to the sheer logistics. The service
                roadmap had three major pillars of development and implementation, these are: Digital infrastructure
                (pink/purple), Physical infrastructure
                (Blue) and Marketing (green).
                <br><br>
                <i>Fifth, the project team developed two artefacts</i> for the service concept. One was developed for
                the web,
                with PC’s and laptops in mind. The other was developed as a mobile application. The project group
                decided that the artefact developed for the web would
                present more in depth data regarding water consumption due to the, generally, larger screen real estate
                available on PC’s and laptops. Meanwhile the app, designed with phones in mind, would present the most
                important data, but less data
                as a whole.
                <br><br>
                <i>Finally the project group drafted some general guidelines</i> for further development of the service,
                this
                encompassed further development of the web and app artefact. As Well as certificates that would need
                development. These certificates was something LBVA
                and VIVAB had expressed that they wanted to be able to supply companies who were “water smart” with.
                <br><br>
                The delivered conceptual service solution had companies of varying sizes in mind and not private
                individuals / households. This was due to the project group observing that a plethora of measures were
                available to households to become more “watersmart”,
                as well as companies of varying sizes being the biggest consumers freshwater.
